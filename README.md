# Kahoot á íslensku
I took Icelandic classes at MúltíKúltí (I'm a Western Icelander that
never spoke Icelandic before!), and our class would play Kahoot on
Fridays. But the thing is, Kahoot was only available in English, and
I thought this was kind of silly.

So I wrote a Tampermonkey userscript that replaces the English
texts with Icelandic texts.

I'm still not perfect at Icelandic, so some strings may be
incorrect, and there are some words and phrases I just threw into
Google Translate.

It may be enough to have the userscript just run on the presenter
screen, but if you want the player screens to also be translated,
the userscript must be installed on all devices as well.
